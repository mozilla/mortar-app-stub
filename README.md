# A Blank Template for Open Web Apps

*This template has been updated with a new structure as of May 2013. Other mortar templates will be updated soon too.*

This is a minimal template that has a little HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help
you start writing an [Open Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps).

This is part of the [mortar](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar/)
template collection for building Open Web Apps.

# Usage

* git clone git://github.com/mozilla/mortar-app-stub.git myapp
